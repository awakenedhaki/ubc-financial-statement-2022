# UBC Remunerations Across Departments

## Background

The University of British Columbia (UBC) is a public research university that ranks in the top 50 universities in the world across THE (2023), AWRU (2022) and QS (2023). 

As part of the British Columbia Financial Information Act, UBC is required to release the remunerations of all its employees. The remunerations are not audited and only names employees that earn greater than 75,000 CAD.

Faculty members at UBC will often require a doctorate degree (i.e. PhD, MD, JD) in their respective field of study. Tenure-tracked appointments at a research institute are generally competitive and require extensive training within a doctoral dissertation and post-doctoral work. The degree of training and competitiveness of a professorship suggests the position offers a noteable compensation.

Once a candidate is successful in securing an appointment at UBC, [their salary is discussed with their Department Head](https://www.facultyassociation.ubc.ca/worklife/salaries/) and they join the [UBC Faculty Association](https://www.facultyassociation.ubc.ca/). A faculty member's remuneration is then subject to increase by (1) collective bargaining every 2 to 4 years, (2) career progress increments, and (3) merit/performance salary adjustments.

Departmental budgets play a key role in shaping faculty compensation. The resources available to a department influence the number of faculty members it can support and their corresponding compensation. This financial interplay extends to cross-departmental appointments, where negotiations may differ based on unique circumstances.
